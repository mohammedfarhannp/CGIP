## 💡 Display Technologies

### **CRT - Cathode Ray Tube**
- Uses an electron beam to excite phosphor dots on the screen, creating images.

### **LCD - Liquid Crystal Display**
- Uses liquid crystals that block or allow light from a backlight to form images.  
- Thin and energy-efficient.

### **LED - Light Emitting Diode**
- Advanced LCDs using LED backlighting instead of fluorescent tubes.  
- Offers better brightness and color accuracy.

### **Plasma Display**
- Uses small cells containing ionized gases that emit light when electrically charged.  
- Provides rich colors and wide viewing angles.
